# twitter-category-nlp
Repository containing all the code for my attempt to label twitter users using NLP.

## Description

Welcome to my project! Here you will find all the code which is needed for:  
  * 1- Download tweets from a particular user (you will need you personal tokens from [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en)). Info from Members of Congress can be found [here](https://triagecancer.org/congressional-social-media)
  * 2- My personal research on the data and on data quality  
  * 3- NLP algorithms and conclusions
