But @senatemajldr won’t bring the bill to the Senate floor. 

He better know people across the country are demanding a vote. And he will see consequences at the ballot box if we don’t have one.

As president I will galvanize the federal government and build on the work of so many who are mobilizing the country to pass background checks, ban assault weapons, &amp; limit magazines.

Believe it or not, we’ve been working so hard that I’ve actually gone down a pants size and need new jeans for the @IowaStateFair.

There's so much wrong with this approach: the school district had no warning that kids would be separated; MS Dept of Child Protection Services found out via public news reports. 

This is either breathtaking negligence or outright cruelty. https://t.co/AqVMvH9atO"|en|D|35|116
