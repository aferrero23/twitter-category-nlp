We must keep employees healthy if we're going to avoid a second wave of infections. Read our letter to @SecGeneScalia here. https://t.co/oITxYdiyvv|en|D|58|168
1265761949985443841|476256944|Wed May 27 21:49:00 +0000 2020|With nearly 39 million workers filing jobless claims since March, we must do more to help businesses rehire and pay their workers. That’s why I’m cosponsoring the Paycheck Security Act. It builds on the CARES Act and ensures more businesses can stay afloat. https://t.co/rwYYNWSbGC|en|D|40|136

We’re asking the bureau to ensure EVERYONE is counted this year. https://t.co/vzeyKffvXG|en|D|38|100

I ask that the administration formulate a more comprehensive strategy with a stronger federal role to coordinate testing efforts. https://t.co/NBRDSCFr39|en|D|39|164

We shouldn’t cut off this much-needed manpower in the middle of a pandemic. I hope the Trump administration allows these deployments to continue and supports Guard members.

1264288239214452738|476256944|Sat May 23 20:13:00 +0000 2020|I’m disappointed the administration is withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty, an agreement that for decades increased transparency between the United States, Russia and our NATO allies. The president is throwing away yet another treaty with Russia, endangering us and our allies. https://t.co/Qn2tsa1XTI|en|D|235|630
1264279628233027584|476256944|Sat May 23 19:38:47 +0000 2020|I’m concerned that HUD has yet to award significant portions of funding appropriated through the CARES Act to help states, counties and cities respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
