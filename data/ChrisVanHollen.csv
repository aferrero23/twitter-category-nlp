Since then, we’ve seen countless attempts to suppress voting rights—including the bad ruling issued today. We must keep fighting to expand access to the ballot box. #RestoreTheVRA https://t.co/CMMnNeE3al|en|D|83|184
1010886435572994049|18137749|Sun Jun 24 14:04:42 +0000 2018|Trump constantly belittles our hardworking federal workforce and proposed a pay freeze even though the cost of living is rising. I’m glad we stood up for our civil servants by voting to give them a modest pay raise. This is an important step but the fight is not over. https://t.co/kv5k6rJbCm|en|D|170|473
1010260304628994049|18137749|Fri Jun 22 20:36:41 +0000 2018|It's been 6 months since Trump added $2 trillion to our debt with his corporate tax giveaway. Since then, big corporations and wealthy stockholders have reaped windfall profits while middle-class wages have remained stagnant. A very bad deal for America. https://t.co/bNy9e8AQMF|en|D|65|130
1010245393970618369|18137749|Fri Jun 22 19:37:26 +0000 2018|For months, the Trump Administration’s waiver process has been shrouded in secrecy—which raises concerns about its legality and what they are trying to hide. I’m glad the Appropriations Committee passed my bipartisan amendment to make this information public and expose this sham. https://t.co/wnMgW2Xohf|en|D|83|224
1010233066244231169|18137749|Fri Jun 22 18:48:26 +0000 2018|Trump vowed not to touch Medicare and Medicaid—so much for that promise. After giving huge tax cuts to big corporations and saddling us with trillions in debt, the GOP wants to gut these vital programs. This budget is no surprise—but working families deserve the truth. https://t.co/sAi1jrBF9h|en|D|239|316
1010196393552728071|18137749|Fri Jun 22 16:22:43 +0000 2018|Pleased to receive bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee yesterday for my amendment ensuring that Turkey cannot obtain F-35 jets if it also buys the Russian S-400 missile system. Allowing this would compromise our national security. https://t.co/oFN9RT7nLD|en|D|33|83
1010179369581645824|18137749|Fri Jun 22 15:15:04 +0000 2018|The @LittleLobbyists have been a vital force in our fight against Trumpcare. I met with them this week to talk about the Trump Administration’s newest efforts to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions. For children like Xiomara, we must keep fighting. https://t.co/JatTfNpY60|en|D|39|104
1009970282101182465|18137749|Fri Jun 22 01:24:14 +0000 2018|While Trump finally bent to public pressure to reverse his despicable child separation policy, his new order does nothing to reunite children who have been taken from their parents and appears to subject children to indefinite imprisonment. Unacceptable. This still isn’t over. https://t.co/aY08lPtJrG|en|D|466|995
1009156529923284994|18137749|Tue Jun 19 19:30:40 +0000 2018|I don’t care how many times the President denies it—he is deliberately separating children from their parents and holding them hostage as a political bargaining tool. Despicable. He has the power to end his inhumane family separation policy with one phone call. https://t.co/bm0WX2dKCB|en|D|207|537
1009060820276449280|18137749|Tue Jun 19 13:10:21 +0000 2018|The Senate passed the amendment I offered with @SenTomCotton to keep the penalties on ZTE for its violations of U.S sanctions. We are pleased that both parties made clear clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first. Trump should end his opposition.|en|D|107|372
1008768502600290305|18137749|Mon Jun 18 17:48:47 +0000 2018|Nielsen's claim here is very deceptive for 2 reasons: First, I spoke personally to a mom who crossed at a legal point of entry. She and her daughter were fleeing death threats in Honduras. Her daughter was taken away and she is now locked up in a detention center. https://t.co/4vJQUOYIRX|en|D|149|275

1008751855005044736|18137749|Mon Jun 18 16:42:38 +0000 2018|Mr. President, I was for cracking down on MS-13 before you learned it wasn't a movie sequel—but at the border I saw 5-year-olds you have taken from their parents. Sure didn't look like MS-13 gang members. We can have secure borders without your cruel family separation policy. https://t.co/NT841QINzw|en|D|399|986
1008561041079521280|18137749|Mon Jun 18 04:04:25 +0000 2018|Finished the last stop of the day, the Port Isabel Detention Center. I heard gut-wrenching testimony from ten women who fled extreme violence in Honduras only to have their children taken away from them. Definitely one of the most emotional moments of the trip. https://t.co/jlazkdA52Z|en|D|1281|1864

Trump Administration didn't let us talk to the kids and they even tried to stop me from recording outside the building. They are clearly sensitive about this trip. This place is packed with kids—over 100 taken from parents. https://t.co/7RVP0ZgT8e|en|D|958|1507

I dare Sessions to look these children in the eye and tell them that the Bible demands this cruelty.|en|D|375|872
