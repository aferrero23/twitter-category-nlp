Now it's the Senate's job to take up this bill so we can open the government and address smart border security &amp; immigration solutions. We cannot shut down the government in order to govern. #EndtheShutdown|en|D|20|73

Today, we remember the four Americans servicemen who were senselessly murdered yesterday in Syria. We are indebted to them and their families for their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/VtzYSGMo4R|en|D|5|21
