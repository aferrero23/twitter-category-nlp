Stop making arguments against an idea that doesn't exist."|en|R|7705|25122

1) The belief that physical barriers can simply be “climbed over”…just like that. 

2) The belief that there’s “no real problem” on the border because 400,000 illegals apprehended on border per year is “insignificant.”"|en|R|6346|18792
